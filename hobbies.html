<UL>
<LI> walking-Walking is one of my favorite hobbies. I walk alone, and with friends for 

activity and fresh air.</LI>
<LI> yoga-This is one of my favorites! You can use a free app like FitOn to find a variety of 

free classes.</LI>
<LI> cycling –Cycling is such a popular hobby now. And with Peloton, you can do this 

hobby with others from the comfort of your home. </LI>
<LI>watercolor painting– This is a recent hobby of mine that I’ve come to enjoy so much. 

Painting is so relaxing, and if you take a course or workshop it also becomes a great social 

activity.</LI>
<LI>calligraphy- Calligraphy was one of my very first adult hobbies. It was such a great skill 

to learn that I still use on occasion.</LI>
<LI>reading –I’ve always been a huge reader. It’s a great hobby for relaxation and self-care, 

as well as a wonderful educational hobby to learn new skills or information.</LI>
<LI>learning a new language –Learning a new language is one hobby I wish I had taken up 

when I was younger. Languages are a challenging, but very rewarding hobby idea.</LI>
